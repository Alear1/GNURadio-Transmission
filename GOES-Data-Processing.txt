GOES16 imager data information: https://docs.opendata.aws/noaa-goes16/cics-readme.html

Currently, 6 types of .lrit files have been received:

YYYYMMDDTTTTT-atl$$$$$_!!!!!!!!!!.lrit
YYYYMMDDTTTTT-CAR_latest.lrit
A_$$$$####$$_YYYYMMDDTTTT_$$$$$$.lrit
OR_ABI-L2-<Instrument Identifier>-<Channel>_<Satellite>_sYYYYMMDDTTTTTT_eYYYYMMDDTTTTTT_cYYYYMMDDTTTTTT.lrit




EMWIN:

A_:
These seem to be all-purpose (maybe that's why it's an A) files, commonly weather round-ups 
from various areas of the US, as well as storm warnings/reports, test information from airports,
information from local weather radars, etc...

Z_:
Images being rebroadcast from the GOES-16 satellite that originated from other satellites or weather radar systems

in the goesrecv.conf file:

[[handler]]
type = "emwin"
dir = <path_to_dir>

OR_:
The meat and potatoes of the data, these are the operational realtime data files. By default goesproc processes
data from the CMIP product, but it can be configured to output data from the other products too (SST in progress).
